At my studio, we've started asking ourselves just that, when it comes to our daily work, and when assessing projects and their impact on the climate, and we're asking our partners to do the same. Making such enormous changes is both challenging and inspiring. There is so much to be done – on a personal, cultural, political, and economic level. It’s encouraging to see Tate taking an official stand on the climate emergency. I am especially happy that the announcement coincides with my exhibition, giving us the opportunity to work together to inspire further climate action.
