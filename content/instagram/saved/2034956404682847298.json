The show is called \"Edible Futures,\" and debuted in Ottawa, Canada this week, on the 27th of April. The exhibition will continue to travel to Vancouver in September and Toronto in January. The exhibition takes the visitor far into the future and looks back onto present day. By taking the liberty of stepping into a world of completely speculative scenarios, the visitor is removed from their daily reality and is allowed to think freely, unconnected to the boundaries of our time.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThe work pictured is part of the show and was the Graduation project of Alexandra Genis called Atoma. It is a spice collection made up of the molecular compounds responsible for different tastes. The flavours are modelled in cocoa butter to reflect their individual chemical structure and can be grated over food. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nDAE Alumni are all of the BA Food Non Food department. Alexandra Genis ('18), Marie Caye ('17 CumLaude) (as part of Arvid&Marie together with Arvid Jense), Laila Snevele ('18) and Shaakira Jassat ('19).⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n@al.alkaloid @mariecaye @ArvidJense @laila_creative_food @studio_sway\n\n#DAEAlumni #DAE #designacademyeindhoven #design #foodnonfood #canada #future #design #research #dutch #dutchdesign","created_at":1556865084}}}
