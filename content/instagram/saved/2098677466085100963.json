Nestled on the banks of Lake Llanquihue is the city of Frutillar - also known as the ‚ÄúCity of Music‚Äù\n‚Ä¢\nFrutillar was founded in 1856 by displaced German families who were struggling to survive in Germany after the onset of the Industrial Revolution. In an effort to attract settlers to the region, the Germans were invited to the Los Lagos area by Chilean diplomat Vicente Perez Rosales\n‚Ä¢\nFirst discovered by Bernardo Philippi a decade earlier, Lake Llanquihue is known for its natural beauty. The second largest lake in Chile, it is situated at the base of the Orsono Volcano and is surrounded by the Andes Mountains. In total there are four cities on the Lake: Puerto Varas, Llanquihue, Puerto Octay, and Frutillar\n‚Ä¢\nRosales and Philippi‚Äôs efforts to colonize the region proved to be successful with the establishment of the four settlements and a blossoming economy rooted in agriculture and forestry. Also heralded for its education, the Frutillar‚Äôs German schools proved to the best in the region. In 1945, a second wave of settlers arrived when Jewish refugees arrived from Germany\n‚Ä¢\nToday, Frutillar is known for its beautiful black sand beaches, colonial German architecture, and attractions like The German Museum; the Teatro del Lago (Lake Theater); the ‚ÄãCofradia Nautica de Frutillar and the Lake‚Äôs largest Yacht Club\n‚Ä¢\nKnow more?
