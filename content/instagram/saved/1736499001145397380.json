Decided to order from my fav Italian place in the neighborhood through @seamless called Gina's and got the best dish which is their Spaghetti Aglio Olio & Pepperoncino because I know it's Vegan from them (AND ALL THAT GARLIC IS LIFE). I have been ordering through @seamless for a few years now and it is perfect for just quickly ordering on the computer and having alllll my favorite local NYC restaurants at the palm of my hands. It also just saves time calling, being put on hold, and having to repeat your order a few times. This way I can just click what I want and be able to make notes like *nut allergy* or *no cheese* if needed. I definitely recommend checking out @seamless & their Instagram for some more foodie inspo. They're just the freaking best. Hope you all are having an amazing day! #HowNewYorkEats #SeamlessPartner","created_at":1521226834}}}
