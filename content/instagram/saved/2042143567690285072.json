This week we showed projects on our feed that bear a reference to the events of this week that celebrate freedom in Europe after the Second World War.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIn this instance a work on the freedom to have a humane environment as a prisoner. The work is by Nel Verbeke and called 'Shape your space' (BA Man and Leisure, '15 CumLaude).⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n'The Dutch town of Veenhuizen is home to a large penitentiary equipped with a recreational area. Anonymous and empty, the space remains unused. With ‘Props’ – a modular furniture system in the broadest sense – Nel Verbeke aims to spark a dialogue between the space and the user. The prisoners can take the lead as true protagonists, able to make, choose and arrange these interior elements into new settings. In this way they are given the freedom to offer their own input, shaping their space into a more humane environment. A series of three accompanying books introduces the concept, DIY guidelines and range of possible compositions.'⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n@nelverbeke⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nFor more information check: www.nelverbeke.com⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nPicture by @alexanderpopelier⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n#freedom #DAEAlumni #DAE #designacademyeindhoven #design #research #boyscouts","created_at":1557662509}}}
