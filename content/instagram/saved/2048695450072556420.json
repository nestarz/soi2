The next few days on our Instagram will therefore show DAE graduation projects that use the EU as their work field or as a topic of investigation.\n\nThis is a project called 'Book for Sale' by Ilse Meulendijks (BA Man and Leisure '17). Ilse Meulendijks: “I consider printed books as beautiful objects, almost pieces of art,” she says. “But Dutch printers are moving towards mass production: it’s hard to find small-scale print shops who are into special editions.” During an internship in Athens, she found that there are plenty of Greek craftsmen who are. On her ‘Book for Sale’ platform European designers can discover the artisans of Athens to co-create and realise exclusive designs. Her handcrafted hardcover about the project is the first product of this creative network that crosses borders to save books and businesses.'\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n@ilsemeulendijks @bookforsale00 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nWebsite: https://studiojuxta.nl/\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n#eu #europeanunion #democracy #DAEAlumni #DAE #research #design #bookprinting\n\nPhotography by Femke Rijerman","created_at":1559667387}}}
