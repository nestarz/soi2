Arrange any number of objects on the pedestal, like a still life, and the computer program will read the scene you create. By classifying the objects based on the qualities they represent, it predicts and produces possible interpretations for your arrangement. With a growing database at its core, Carl’s installation is able to link an almost infinite number of combinations to different theories, ranging from religious symbolism to the meaning of certain emojis in contemporary pop-culture. ‘Everything is Placed Deliberately’ confronts us with a metaphorical way of thinking for the computer.’\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nWant to find out what AI could mean for design?
