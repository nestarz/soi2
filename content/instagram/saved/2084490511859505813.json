I’ve really taken my time to settle in after my move back across the country in March. Though truthfully, I’ve mostly been allowing space for some pretty major life lessons to sink in and integrate. Who else has had a MAMMOTH last few months? So many ups, so many downs; all experiences being converted into knowledge and wisdom. I still haven’t found a pottery in the Noosa area to replace my love for @northcotepotterysupplies, but I’m finally laying down some roots in my new home, & I’m excited to start creating again. I’ll be becoming increasingly active in this space over the next couple of seasons. Watch out for updates & expressions of my love x chat again soon. -Clo.","created_at":1562710655}}}
