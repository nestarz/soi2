But what about the intestines? Interested in making use of the unused, Kathrine Barbo Bendixen found ‘a second life’ for these unloved innards. ‘Inside Out’ is a man-made lamp with an animal-made material and shape. It comprises 50 metres of cleaned, inflated intestines from a single cow. The twist is natural, as is the white, mother-of-pearl sheen; LED tube lights inserted inside account for the glow. As the air slowly escapes over time, the lamp − like the cow that produced it − will perish. The design is meant for sustainable restaurants; with their new dishes they may also have to introduce new lights.'\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n@studiokbb ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n#DAEalumni #DAE #design #light #research\n\nPhotography by Ronald Smits","created_at":1559051669}}}
