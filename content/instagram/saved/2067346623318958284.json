Do all roads really lead to Rome? The designers Benedikt Gross and Philipp Schmidt tried to find out by working with the digital geographer Raphael Reimann to design a data visualisation of the most efficient road routes to Rome from all over Europe. And by “all over”, they meant from 486,713 stating points across the continent. (Yes, even in poor, Brexit-stricken, Boris-dreading Britain.) They then developed an algorithm to identify the smartest route from each of those places. This delicate web of spidery lines is the result. The closer you zoom in on different places in the interactive map (at http://roadstorome.movielab.com/countries) the more geographic details will be revealed. In a nod to the efficiency with which Ancient Romans designed and built roads in many of their conquests, the more frequently a real road is used as a means of reaching Rome on the map, the more prominently it appears.\n\n#design #mapping #informationdesign #datavisualization #benediktgross #philippschmidt #raphaelreimann #allroadsleadtorome #designontheroad","created_at":1560673771}}}
