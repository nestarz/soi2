In this instance a work on weapons of mass destruction by Hannah Luttervelt called 'Playing with weapons' (BA Man and Leisure '16 CumLaude)\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n'They look so cute and cuddly. But look again and you’ll see them for what they are: bombs, missiles and mortars. As toy guns are popular as ever, Hannah van Luttervelt presents the next step with these toys of mass destruction. Although they are made from soft wool, the shape and size are for real. The biggest of them all is a stuffed replica of the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, which ironically was nicknamed ‘Little Boy’. Could the contradiction be any more obvious? A short accompanying movie shows how politicians play with their bombs like boys with their toys. Isn’t it time to stop this madness?'\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nFor more information on her work: hannahvanluttervelt.nl\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n@hannahvanluttervelt\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nPicture by Femke Rijerman\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n#DAEAlumni #DAE #designacademyeindhoven #design #freedom #liberationday #5mei","created_at":1557324043}}}
