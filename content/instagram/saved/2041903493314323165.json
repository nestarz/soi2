It states clearly that our human activity is taking down one million plants and animals, causing the sixth extinction event on this planet. Itâ€™s happening at an incredibly fast and accelerating rate. A million beautiful, ancient creatures like Sudan might breathe their last breath in our lifetime (here, in his final moments, Sudan was comforted by dedicated @olpejeta keeper Zacharia Mutai). Witnessing the last of anything die is something I never want to do again. Witnessing it a million times over may be more than my heart can stand and may be more than our fragile ecosystem can bear. Nature needs us now.\n\nSupport and engage @conservationorg @nature_org @nature_africa and other orgs working to build a future in which we can live in harmony with nature. In order to protect prevent more heartbreaking deaths like this, we need to conserve 30% of the planet by 2030. @safariparkdvurkralove #rhinos #DontLetThemDisappear #stoppoaching #kenya","created_at":1557633892}}}
