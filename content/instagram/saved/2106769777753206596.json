A mobile public toilet for women that addresses the gender inequality and discrimination inherent in the current lack of such facilities for women.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThere are plenty of urinals for men scattered around the city. So why is there nothing for women? For Elisa Otañez, this is an example of the persistent sexism built into daily existence. The arresting yellow colour of the cubicle and the bold typeface emblazoned across the sides uses the visual language of activism to highlight the need for change. The temporary nature of the cubicle is a critique of the fact that there is nothing permanent yet in place. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n#DAE #designresearch #DesignAcademyEindhoven #research #StudyatDAE #BAdesign #MAdesign #StudyatDAE #designthinking #feminism #activism","created_at":1565366556}}}
