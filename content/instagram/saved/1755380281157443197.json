The two previously met on Grimes' “Venus Fly,” and here Grimes’ head spinning, bubblegum pop aesthetic influences producers Nate Wonders and Chuck Lightning's spacious R&B beat. There are still the Prince-ly guitar riffs and funky rhythms of Monae’s past hits, but the track’s most pleasurable moments are accompanied by Grimes’ gentle digital bleeps, understated finger snaps, and a plush, fluttering vocal line from Monae. When the two come together on the chorus to exclaim, “We got the pink!” it feels both punk and psychedelic, like a cross between the Go-Gos and George Clinton. As an expression of unity and an appeal to see people beyond gender, the song’s genre-bending sonics and the video’s femme-dominated utopia underscore Monae’s long-held desires for a more fluid society. Flirty and delicate, wishful and raw, “PYNK” finds Monae building a future worth believing in. 🎧 Listen to the track → Link in bio","created_at":1523477658}}}
