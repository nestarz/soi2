In a new interview with Uncut, Tillman said, “Most of this next album was written in a six-week period where I was kind of on the straits.” He also said it’s “the real I Love You, Honeybear but without the cynicism,” and called it “a heartache album.” In addition, Tillman revealed some working track titles: “Mr Tillman, Please Exit the Lobby,” “Ouch, I’m Drowning,” “Dum Dum Blues,” and “Well, We’re Only People and There’s Nothing Much We Can Do About It.”","created_at":1510851943}}}
