In this first post I talk about my daily sketching process and look at some of the techniques I explored in my first year. Find the full article on my website (link in bio.) I'll be going more in depth into many of these topics soon, thanks for following!\n.\nShout out to @zach.lieberman, whose writing on daily sketching inspired me to start myself. Admittedly, this first post is in part modeled after his articles on the topic. .\nAlso thanks to @willcgeary for pointing me towards Zach's work last year, @l05_ for initially introducing me to Touchdesigner, and the rest of the generative and interactive art community which serves as a constant source of inspiration.\n.\n.\n#TouchDesigner #everyday #generative #generativedesign #generativeart #dailysketching #iterativedesign #iteration #creativecoding #mediaart #artandtechnology #interactiveart #interactiondesign #newmediaart #newmedia #design #tutorial #code #complexsystems #process #creativeappsnet #contemporaryart #codeart #audioreactive #audiovisual","created_at":1556547203}}}
