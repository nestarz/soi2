After the success of 16 Animali, Enzo Mari developed new toys and games for Danese, treating each project as an opportunity to explore the psychology of play. One of his objectives was to understand how his own children, Michele and Agostina, related to their toys. Another was to devise new ways for them to play with other people, including himself. Typical was The Fable Game, which was launched in 1959 as a set of large, colourful cards, each bearing an image of an animal, bird, plant or tree that children would recognise from real life and popular fables. The players slotted the cards together in seemingly countless combinations to tell different stories through each sequence of images. Mari was convinced that if children were given the freedom to determine the outcome of a game, they would be less likely to tire of it. He introduced that element to many other play-related design projects over the years, as well as another defining theme of The Fable Game, the invention of a specific set of rules designed by himself.\n\n#design #designandplay #enzomari #thefablegame @danese.milano #theplayfulenzomari","created_at":1564772376}}}
