Ayhua is from the Awã, indigenous people of the eastern Brazilian Amazon. Her family came out of isolation in 1989 and she has lived in ‘contact’ ever since. Some Awã remain in voluntary isolation in the state of Maranhão and are considered highly vulnerable as threats to their land, particularly from logging, are considerable. The Awã like to keep wild animals as pets but seem to have a particular love of monkeys - many Awã women keep small tamarin monkeys as pets and often keep them on their heads.
