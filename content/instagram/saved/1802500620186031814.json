It’s a bit of work to make everything, but I promise it’s SO worth it. .\n.\nPasta Sauce \n2 cups of roasted tomatoes\n1 cup of roasted white onion\n4-6 roasted garlic cloves\n1 cup of soaked cashews\n1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar\n3-4 tbsp of lemon juice\n3-4 leaves of fresh or dried sage\n2 tbsp of nutritional yeast\n1 cup of water + 1/4 of pasta water\n2 tsp of salt or to taste\nDirections\n\nPre-heat oven to 350 F, roughly chop onions, garlic, and tomatoes. Coat them with some oil and lay them on a baking sheet (with parchment paper) and bake for 30 minutes. Take them out of the oven and let them cool for a bit. \nThen add all ingredients (including roasted veggies and excluding pasta water) into a high-speed blender like a @blendtec. Blend until completely emulsified or until the sauce becomes very warm in the blender. \nSet aside. .\n.\nThe \"Meat\" Mushrooms\n2 1/2 cups of shiitake mushrooms or alternative\n1 tbsp of garlic powder\n1 tbsp of italian seasoning\n2 tbsp of avocado oil or alternative\n2 tbsp of lemon juice\n1 tbsp of coconut sugar\n1 tsp of black pepper\n1 tsp of salt .\n.\nBalsamic Cherry Tomatoes\n3 cups of cherry tomatoes\n3-4 tbsp of balsamic vinaigrette\na pinch of salt and pepper\nDirections\n\nTake a large packet of brown rice fetucchini pasta or regular pasta and cook according to packaging. \nWhile it’s boiling mix all mushroom ingredients in a bowl, lay them on a baking sheet and bake for 30 min.\nDo the same for the cherry tomatoes, mix in a bowl then lay them on a baking sheet and bake for 30 mins. Of course, you may do this at the same time. \nThen strain the pasta and rinse with cold water(remember to save 1/4 of a cup of pasta water), so it doesn't overcook while you let it sit. \nTake your sauce and cook down a bit on a large pan, let it get thick and creamy. Takes 10 mins or so. Once it starts boiling, add your pasta, and roasted mushrooms. \nMix thoroughly and if needs more water you may add some pasta water and mix well. Turn off heat, top this with the roasted cherry tomatoes, and cilantro","created_at":1529127241}}}
