Let me know how you like this super green soup and I’ll take photos of the other recipes and post them soon! Also, if you want a detox soup take out the coconut sugar! :) PS if you make any of my recipes tag me and I’ll share them! ❤️\n.\nSupe Green Soup (3-4 servings) \n1 cup of chopped asparagus \n1 cup of chopped celery \n1 cup of fennel bulb \n1/2 a cup of fennel stock and leaves \n2 large hand fulls of chopped kale \n5-6 garlic cloves\n1/2 a cup of chopped onions \n1/2 a cup of fresh mint\n2 thumbs of ginger \n2 tbsp of oil\n3 tbsp of a cup of lime juice\n1 tbsp of sweetener of choice (optional) \n1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar (ACV) \n1 1/2 tsp of salt or to taste \n1 1/2 cups of vegetable stock (low sodium) \n1/3-1/2 a cup of water .\n.\nDirections \nWash and chop all veggies\n\nHeat up pot (med-high), add oil and onions. Sauté for 5 min. Then add your ginger, garlic, and fennel bulb. Sauté for 5 min.\n\nAdd your asparagus, celery, fennel bulb, and sauté for another 5 min. Lower heat and add your kale mix well. Turn off heat.\n\nThen add your sautéed veggies to a high-speed blender, plus your fresh mint, veg stock, water, sweetener, ACV, and salt. Blend until desired consistency. I tried both smooth and chunky and they are both delicious. At the end add your lime juice, slight blend or mix again. \nTopped with yogurt, black pepper, and cilantro. Enjoy.","created_at":1526589762}}}
