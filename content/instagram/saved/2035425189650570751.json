Home to approximately 60,000 Br√ºnnich's guillemots that nest on the towering cliff face, Alkefjellet is a magnificent sight. The cliff itself is made up of basaltic pillars, in places over 100 meters high, that rise vertically out of the Hinlopen Strait. These sheer rock faces are home to thousands of nesting birds, often circled by glaucous gulls looking for a meal and Arctic foxes hunting nearby. Please follow me @andy_mann for more from this Arctic paradise!","created_at":1556861619}}}
