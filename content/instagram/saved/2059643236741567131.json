But these inner spaces are inaccessible to the inhabitants. And in today’s dense metropolis, it is a shame to leave them empty. With ‘Lightening the Interspaces’ Alice Bleton aims to adopt and adapt these voids with a suspended series of shared balconies and platforms. The new structural connections also stimulate social ties, drawing people outside for a breath of fresh air in the sun. The use of etched copper mesh keeps everything airy, creating an interesting interplay of light and shadow on the surroundings.'⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nCan you imagine yourself thinking about spatiality, light and redesigning cities?
