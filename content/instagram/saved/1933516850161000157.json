Look no further because I have here a recipe that’s gluten free, soy free, free from any weird ingredient and to tell you it is a bit difficult to make. It’s basically made like a pancake, so if you can make pancakes then I’d say it will be easy to make. Aside from the gluten free aspect of teff flour it’s also amazingly high in iron, protein, fiber, magnesium, and so much more. I swear by this grain, it has helped me lose some excess body fat! It also keeps you super full and let me tell ya this burger patty is on point.\n.\nTeff Patty \n1 cup of chopped mushrooms \n1/2 a cup of Cooked black beans (strained & rinsed)\n1/2 a cup of teff flour + 1 tbsp @teffco \n2 tbsp of black bean juice \n1 tbsp of acv\n1 tbsp of almond butter \n2 tsp of garlic granules\n1/4 of a cup of onions diced \n2 tsp of salt \n1 tsp of oregano .\n.\nToppings\nOnions\nTomatoes\nVegan Cheese\nBBQ sauce\nSprouts \nLettuce .\n.\nMakes 5-4 patties .\n.\nDirections \nRoughly chop up mushrooms that measure to about a cup worth (a little over doesnt make a big difference) \nAdd the chopped mushrooms, cooked black beans(strained and rinsed), and all the other patty ingredeints into the blender. \nUsing a high speed blender, blend mixture for 40 sec or so. Untill you dont see big chunks of mushrooms. \nThen add the filling in a large galon size ziplock bag and on the corner of the bag cut an inch size hole to make a sort of a funnel. \nThen heat up a non stick pan, (on medium heat) and add a bit of oil. Pour mixture formaing a patty and slightly form it as well with a silicon spatula to make a uniform size.(Almost making a pancake of this helps visually) Cook each one side for about a minute(if it doesn’t flip, it’s not ready to flit yet)  and once one side is cooked flip it and add cheese on the cooked side and to make it melt add 1 tbsp of water and cover it to make it melt. (Cook for 1 min or more) Once your patties are done construct your burger. Makes about 4-6 patties depending on the size of them.","created_at":1544713423}}}
