Merle Bergers has translated the magnified details of a tomato plant into a tactile piece of art, oozing a mist with familiar plant scents. Three selfmade perfumes address the nose just like plants do: ‘attract’ is flowery and sweet, ‘repel’ has an acid note and ‘defend’ smells of freshly mowed grass. The accompanying film, made through a microscope, shows how it works in real life. \nBy realising plants are living, communicating creatures, and recognising their meaningful perfume, we might learn to treat the green scene with more respect. After all, we need it to survive.'\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nAre you interested to become a Bachelor student at the Design Academy? For instance to study at the Food non Food department?
