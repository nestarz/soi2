The North Atlantic Right whale is the most endangered species of whale on the planet. It is estimated that only 450 remain, and research shows that an alarming 17 North Atlantic Right Whales died in 2017. About 50 North Atlantic right whales become tangled in human fishing gear each year, and about 83% of all whales have gotten caught at least once. Entangled whales often drown or die from starvation or injuries. \nNew types of fishing gear have been developed - including the use of weaker ropes for lobster and crab traps and electronically controlled traps - to reduce the impact of fishing material on these creatures. If used properly, this innovative gear could save these animals. If such solutions are not implemented however, this species could become extinct within a few years.\n\nPhotographed on assignment for @NatGeo.\n\nTo see more underwater photography, and to learn more about the incredible species of our planet, follow me - @BrianSkerry - on Instagram. \n#right #whale #endangered #species #onassignment #national #geographic #bay #of #fundy #canada #north #atlantic #nature #photography #conservation #preservation","created_at":1518199700}}}
