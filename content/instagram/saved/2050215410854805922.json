Between the 23-26 of May the European Parliament election will take place in all the EU countries, 420 million people are able to vote. The next few days on our Instagram will therefore show DAE graduation projects that use the EU as their work field or as a topic of investigation. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThis is 'MATERIALISED THEORY' a project by Rik Maarsen (BA Man and Leisure '18)\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n'Rik developed an educational tool that visualises the complicated theory of macro-economics in a tangible model for high school students. He created a map of Europe with 3D-printed models of banks and parliament buildings forms the playground for an interactive session of economics. By loaning money for national investments and by reconstructing the events that led to Greece’s troubles, students experience the cause and effect of economic crisis first hand.'\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nWebsite: www.rikmakes.space\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n#eu #europeanunion #democracy #DAEAlumni #DAE #research #votetogether #design\n\nPhotography by Femke Rijerman","created_at":1559667289}}}
