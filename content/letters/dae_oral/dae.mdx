Hi,

I'm Elias, a former Data Scientist and Deep Learning engineer
I used to study Cognitive Science during my bachelor and I do Web developpement as a freelance.

I want to use this knowledge and expertize to rethink our position towards data, as people.
How we gather it and how we profit from it.

Also, I'm shifting from a pure scientific path
because I want to act as a citizen and conceive, suggest, search from this point of view.

Therefore, I'm advocating for more social and tangible outputs with society problem in mind.
For example, how can we help us be more armed to face life choices using our own data. Or again,
How data can be valuable but not locking for our personal developpement. How is an object conceived to gather data or process it can live trough ages and still be valuable. How can we use data as a tool to create unique objects, with high evocation, and low ecological footprint. How can we build instrument that use data to create new way of doing, new way of exploring ourselves, our body, our environnement. How are those new way resilient of time, open to anyone, hackable, simple ?

Those are ones of many questions I want to adress during this formation.
