To Whom it May Concern,

As a former Deep Learning student and later engineer I certainly saw and still see information as a crucial asset to have, anyone can see how is build Google's business model or how Data Scientist employment market is going up.

Trough professionnal experience, media or just friends, I know well how data processing can be perceived as magic to anyone not familiar with computer science. If you hold a smartphone more than your pen in a day, it is still way more a black box than the pen, even for me.

Here sit my shift from where I belonged in the first place: the classical scientific path.

I need to reconnect with earth, with people and with what drives me.
I want to search how can we make our lives easier to live, but not easy.
I need to know how can we make our lives more rewarding, but not without effort.
I need to know how can I advocate for objects and experiences, that are open to anyone, that is valuable for anyone, but not liked by everyone.
I don't think we need to force things in a world that is already complicated, we need to keep it simple, stupid.
I need to search ways that people can use to see through this bomb of data we get everyday from everywhere in our citizen life.
I need to search ways to help me and people be more armed to face life choices, and I mean not any prediction system that would replace or help our critical spirit, but I'm thinking of encouraging us to try, sense and select by our own in the first place.

I want to invite to things. Let anyone hack, share, copy, steal, destroy, build from scratch things. It is more a state of mind than an actual process.

I sheer the day I would find an actual process that would both give birth to something meaningful to ones, something aesthetics and something that is not permenently linked to a computer, something that can live trough ages but still couldn't have been made without the virtual world.

I know this spirit live in computer science, I've experienced it, I've been involved into Open-Source projects and I've used them too. But, here is the rub, it's still software, and even if it was hardware. I don't want it to be an arduino base system all the time. I may only want wood, ceramic, glass, ink on paper, bacteria, plastic bottle forsaken on a beach based object.

Like a pen, simple and agnostic of who you are, but you can use it to draw dragons, write the next law or even use it as sarbacanne like you were in junior school. You negociate with the pen, you evolve with it but it never own you.

I'm not saying to go back in time, as I like to solve problems using code and as I'm convinced we can use today's science and technology to enrich our world, enrich our lives, make us wonder, question ourselves, help minorities, help beat diseases, and prevent irreversible damage to people and conflicts.

But I advocate for black-box-free objects that may have be thinked using thoses black-box. And let them as tools to create, not as further bareer between people, and not to dictate an experience.

Best,
