Hello Olivier van Herpt,

I saw your works at Manufacture Bernardaud @ Limoges and I was excited to experiment and create like you did. It was awesome !

Currently studying Ceramics and Object Design at Auguste Renoir in Paris, France, I'm a former Computer Vision and Deep Learning engineer. I am exploring the interaction of objects, people, art and technology using creative code, ceramics and others materials.

I am trying to develop an approach that combines science and art, science and design in a process that is not classical, I want to hack things and prototype while being focused on the object, the uses and/or the political or aesthetical expression.
Akin to research with artists and designers to elaborate projects and learn from them, while being expressive I wanted to know if you had any plans for internship in the end of year or if you could advise me in this area. Do not hesitate if like me you want more info!

Best,
