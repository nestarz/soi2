description: 'Creative domains render a big part of modern society, having a strong
  influence on economy and cultural life. Much effort within creative domains, such
  as fashion, art and design, centers around the creation, consumption and analytics
  of creative visual content. In recent years, there has been an explosion of research
  in applying machine learning and computer vision algorithms to various aspects of
  the creative domains including generating, analyzing and processing visual content.
  This ever-increasing interest is most evident in two important research trends:
  (1) Computer Vision for Fashion and (2) Visual Content Generation for Creative Applications.'
