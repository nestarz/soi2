description: "Over the past few years, generative machine learning and machine creativity\
  \ have continued grow and attract a wider audience to machine learning. Generative\
  \ models enable new types of media creation across images, music, and text - including\
  \ recent advances such as sketch-rnn and the Universal Music Translation Network.\
  \ This one-day workshop broadly explores issues in the applications of machine learning\
  \ to creativity and design. We will look at algorithms for generation and creation\
  \ of new media and new designs, engaging researchers building the next generation\
  \ of generative models (GANs, RL, etc). We investigate the social and cultural impact\
  \ of these new models, engaging researchers from HCI/UX communities and those using\
  \ machine learning to develop new creative tools. In addition to covering the technical\
  \ advances, we also address the ethical concerns ranging from the use of biased\
  \ datasets to building tools for better \u201CDeepFakes\u201D. Finally, we\u2019\
  ll hear from some of the artists and musicians who are adopting machine learning\
  \ including deep learning and reinforcement learning as part of their own artistic\
  \ process. We aim to balance the technical issues and challenges of applying the\
  \ latest generative models to creativity and design with philosophical and cultural\
  \ issues that surround this area of research."
