description: "The School for Poetic Computation is an artist-run school in New York that was founded in 2013. A small group of students and faculty work closely to explore the intersections of code, design, hardware and theory — focusing especially on artistic intervention. It’s a hybrid of a school, residency and research group. Our motto is: more poetry, less demo"
