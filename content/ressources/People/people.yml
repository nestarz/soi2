    alias: Albertine Meunier
    url: https://www.albertinemeunier.net/
    description: Albertine Meunier pratique l’art dit numérique depuis 1998 et utilise tout particulièrement Internet comme matériau. Elle se définit elle-même comme une net artiste, artiste pas nette. Cette expression bien que légèrement désuète - un net artiste étant tout simplement un artiste de son temps - contribue à lui conférer un visage humain, bien loin de la froideur des machines numériques.
