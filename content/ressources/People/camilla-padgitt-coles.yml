description: I am a multimedia artist (Camilla Padgitt-Coles, b. 1985, New York, NY) working in audio-visual environments and installations. Coming from a background of painting and drawing, for the past 10 years I have been creating physical real-time atmospheres with light, color and sound. My recent research is examining more specifically how and where art and meditation can combine to create playful experiences through using different sensors, data or inputs in order to inspire an unpredictability or interactivity that is personalized to the viewer. The aim is to create a "moment" or experience where the viewer feels connected in a very basic way to simplicity, relaxation and/or joy and grounding in the body through the senses.
