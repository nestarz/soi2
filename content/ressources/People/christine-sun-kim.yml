description: Christine Sun Kim is an American sound artist who has been deaf since birth. Based in New York City, she started as a visual artist, but developed an interest in sound as a medium because of the "rules" society attaches to it and her disconnect from sound as most people experience it. She states her mission is to "unlearn sound etiquette."
