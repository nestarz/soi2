description: "regl is a technology meant to simplify building awesome things with WebGL. Recently, Mikola Lysenko, one of the creators of regl, gave a great talk at OpenVis Conf that got me wanting to spend more time with WebGL and regl in particular - to see how it could be applied to my data visualization work."
