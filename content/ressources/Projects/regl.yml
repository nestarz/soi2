description: regl is a new functional abstraction for wegbl. Using regl is easier
  than writing raw webgl code because you don't need to manage state or binding. it's
  also lighter and faster and has less overhead than many existing 3d frameworks.
  and it has a functional data-driven style inspired by react.
