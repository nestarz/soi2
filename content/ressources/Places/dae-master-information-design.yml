description: Established in 2010, the Master Information Design is one of four master
  programmes at Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE). The two-year curriculum is set up
  around research and design assignments, given by the design tutors, writing and
  thesis supervisors, and lectures and workshops given by guest lecturers. During
  the second year, students work on individual research themes, which they have formulated
  themselves. In order to formulate topical research themes the master programmes
  cooperate with external institutions, governments, companies, leading experts, as
  well as with the researchers of the DAE- Readerships.
